Groove fillers: Torukmakto4 original article: http://torukmakto4.blogspot.com/2018/01/hy-con-cage-refinements-gen2-wheel.html.  His has about 0.75mm clearence to wheel.

  Pusher Bottom Measurements
    2.7 from pusher port top to top wall top. 
    Padd is 3 mm


Doh! Pusher height cannot be above 2.7

Setting it to 2.5 oughta be good, and should be strong enough tm.

for some suggestions on good tolerences here.
My bore axis is 8.35 mm below the magazine well top, which suggessts I want to extend my feed guide 2.35 mm down. That's damn close to what I'm currently using, 2 mm down!

73 down.
14 extra mm added.
